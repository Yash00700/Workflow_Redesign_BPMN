# Workflow_Redesign_BPMN
Description: 
Considering the current system, while applying for jobs many companies ask you to apply externally. 
In this process, they ask you to create a login for their portal and fill in some details/forms. 
Ideally one job application process for 1 company takes around 20 minutes. 
As people apply for multiple companies and multiple positions, they need to repeat the same process for each company. 
This can be a very time consuming and lengthy process. 
For instance, a student is applying for X company then he/she needs to sign up in one portal like linkedin or Handshake, then fill up everything and systems provide information for job suggestions according to his/her profile. 
During the time of the application process he/she needs to apply externally via Workdays or some other application and repeat that process for an endless number of times while applying for a new job. 
So, it is a hectic and time consuming process for students.

We used IS Process Analysis and Should Process Analysis for this project. 
We created conceptual data model, used rummeler matrix took help of key re-engineering principles.
